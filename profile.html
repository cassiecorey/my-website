        <h1>About me</h1>
        <hr class="jumbo">
        <p>I'm a rising senior studying computer science at UMass Amherst. My track is in artificial intelligence. I enjoy solving complex math problems and brain teasers. Outside of academics, I love volunteering in a variety of ways and participating in any activities that keep me on my feet (like dancing in the woods). I'm using this website to practice web-development - something I'm very new to.</p>

            <p>In the 1st grade, my mother decided I should learn how to play an instrument. She gave me three choices: piano, trumbone, or violin.</p>
            <p>When I replied, "Violin." Her response was a sigh. "You don't even know what a violin is."</p>
            <p>"Yes I do," I said. "It has four strings and you play it like this." I lifted my hands up into the classic violin pose and pretended to play. She nodded her surpised agreement and enrolled me in Suzuki lessons.</p>

            </div>
            <p>My sports career began in highschool after a friend of mine suggested I try out for the crew team. I moved quickly up through the boats as I continued rowing throughout highschool. After graduating and taking first place as 2nd seat at the Royal Henley Women's Regatta in England, I decided to focus my attention on wrestling instead.</p>
            <p>I had begun wrestling when the boarding school I went to required all non-freshman to be on a sports team. After trying out and being cut from the indoor track team in the winter of my sophomore year, I looked up to the elevated track above the dirt track where I had just proven my lack of running skills. Above me, clad in matching grey sweats, was a group of boys running laps in silence. Influenced by a friend of ours who was already a member of the team, my girlfriend and I decided to try out for wrestling.</p>

            <p>Every year since I learned to play the violin, I have volunteered on Christmas at nursing homes playing music for the elderly. During the rest of the year, I volunteer as a visitor playing card games and chatting with some of the residents who recieve less-frequent or no family visitors at all.</p>
            <p>In addition to this continuing service, I try to involve myself in any volunteer opportunity I have the time for both at work and in school.</p>
            <p>I'm also a two-time blood donor and hoping to donate a lot more!</p>

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>I have one piece of writing that has been published online and in print by my highschool. It was a 30-minute spoken meditation. Each senior student is required by the academy to write a meditation and 10 are chosen by faculty to be presented weekly to the student body.</p>
